### AI assistants

In this challenge, you are allowed to use any kind of AI assistant to aid you in your development process. However, it's crucial to adhere to the following guidelines:

1. **Explanation of Code**: Any code generated or suggested by the AI assistant must be thoroughly understood and explained in the project documentation if required. This ensures that you fully comprehend the code you are incorporating into the project and can justify its inclusion.

2. **Adherence to Rules**: It's imperative to follow the guidelines and rules set forth in this README document. Any breach of the rules, including failure to explain generated code, will result in a reduction of two points from the final grade for each offense. In the case of two breaches, the challenge will be invalidated.
